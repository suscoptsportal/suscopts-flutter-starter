# Flutter < 3.0.0-alpha+5 Starter for SUSCOPTS apps

(https://flutter.io/) for doc.

This should be quick start, depending on project.

** Recommend adding a loading page to check cache and load general information (like if user logged in check if token is expired).

1) In config.dart file there you can add the basic encyription which could be found in the clergy portal.

2) Under library folder, there is added consts for churchid or groupid if needed. With corresponding login options in the general_api.dart you can just comment out the general login function and uncomment the desigered login function.
